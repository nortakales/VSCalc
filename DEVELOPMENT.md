# Development

* Make sure to use the latest lts of node via `nvm use --lts` or set it to default via `nvm alias default lts/hydrogen` (adjust version from `nvm ls`)
* VSCode should automatically run `npm run watch` while developing
* Run tests manually: `npm run test`

# Publishing

* Make sure to update the version in `package.json`, and optionally tag the commit like `git tag "<version>"` and `git push origin "<version>"`
* Make sure to update `CHANGELOG.md`
* Tests will run before publishing to VSCode marketplace via `vscode:prepublish` in package.json
* If personal access token as expired, run `vsce login <username>`
  * Store latest access key in AWS, retrieve via: `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id vsce-publish-token`
* To publish run `vsce publish`
* Update `vsce` with `npm install -g vsce`

* [x] base (binary, hex) conversion
* [x] "time"
* [ ] time in <city>
* [ ] "next friday"
* [x] support for "ago"
* [x] Seems to be a bug if a document has 1 USD in it, when it loads, it caches a wrong result before currencies load?

* [ ] Enable "yesterday 11pm"
* [ ] Decide on better file extension
* [ ] Fix math API
